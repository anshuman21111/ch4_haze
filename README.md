## Brief Description ##
Methane is a major greenhouse gas and has contributed immensely in steering evolution of life on our planet. Understanding its production and consumption over different timescales has implications in climate sciences, paleobiology and biogeochemistry, as it has been implicated in a wide variety of phenomena such as Proterozoic glacial cycles, Phanerozoic mass extinctions, and global warming via  present-day fluxes from wetland environments. Few past studies have tried to explore the problems of methane flux through ecological interaction models. In this work, we use such a model to explain cyclic behavior in the methane haze episodes of the Neoarchean. We found that an interplay of resources and oxygen availability can cause complex cyclic patterns in methane dynamics, and the qualitative aspects of these dynamics are only affected by the relative availability of resources and oxygen, irrespective of the microbial process efficiencies, initial conditions and constraints.
